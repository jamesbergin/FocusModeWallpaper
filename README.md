# Focus Mode Wallpaper
Code to change the wallpaper based on focus mode

## Background
I like how on iPhones, when the focus mode is changed, the wallpaper can also change.  It is strange to me that this isn't a feature that is enabled in MacOS.

So, I wrote this script, which triggeres via a Shortcut when a focus mode change is detected.  The files for the wallpaper are in a local folder on the machine.  

The script handles that some dynamic wallpaper (HEIC files) need to be treated differently.  Also, that certain focus modes mean that the widgets should be hidden.

It has worked pretty well for me for a while now, and I keep expecting the functionality to be baked in to Mac OS as standard, but until that happens, I'll use this script.
